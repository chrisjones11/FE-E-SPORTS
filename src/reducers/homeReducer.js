The Chinese squad had a wobbly beginning to the tournament but had picked up their game a lot even though they were playing with a stand-in after Chen 'Victoria' Guanhong had a medical condition which meant he had to be replaced. The SEA squad, on the other hand, would be searching for victory and to claim the top spot in the Dota 2 Pro Circuit point rankings – after their withdrawal from the upcoming Dota Pit Minor.",

          "For the first time in their few years history, Infamous have dropped the idea of a full Peruvian roster. They qualified to TI 7 with an Argentinian coach -  who now joined the team in the mid lane position.  Mariano 'P4pita' Caneda boasts being the coach of the first ever South American qualified team to The International and is now playing in the first ever Dota 2 minor. He has done that only through hard work and life changing decisions. We got the chance to have a chat with him on the first day of the PGL Open Bucharest minor, and although it was right after a lost series against LGD Gaming, he was extremely happy to share all of his thoughts and talk about his long journey from pub matches to TI7.",

In regards to the Bo3 grand finals - ESL One Hamburg itself was planned, scheduled and budgeted before the announcement of the 2017-18 Competitive Season and its Pro Circuit. As such it was structured as an eight team, single elimination tournament with the final two days being played inside the Barclaycard Arena in Hamburg. On top of the one million Dollar prize pool, the players are of course also competing for the valuable Pro Circuit points, which are needed to qualify for TI8 down the line. 1500 of those are up for grabs at ESL One Hamburg and only the top four teams will get a share of the spoils.",
